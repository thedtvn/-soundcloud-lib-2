# Soundcloud-lib
This is a Soundcloud API library that doesn't require a client ID to function.  It's basic, it can really only fetch tracks and playlists, but doesn't require the user to go through the soundcloud app approval process.

This is a Clone of https://github.com/3jackdaws/soundcloud-lib/
So go there for newest update

# Installation
This library is installable as a pip package.
```
pip install git+https://github.com/thedtvn/soundcloud-lib.git
```
